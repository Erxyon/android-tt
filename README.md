About
====================
Currently this is an old version of the available version of Android Triple Triad 2 (on the Android Market), because I lost the latest revision.
First I'll use (and improve) some old code, then I'll rewrite from scratch what has to be.
If you see some ugly code, I apologize but it's "normal". I wrote this game when I started to learn how to develop (both Android and Java). I'll improve it step by step (I already started).

What's working
====================
* Settings
* Basic mode (using user defined rules) : User against Hard robot
* Runs on both smartphones and tablets

ToDo
====================
* Rewrite engine
* Finish new Game renderer to use not only random decks and pvp
* Optimize for Android 3+
